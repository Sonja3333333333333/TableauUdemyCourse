# SECTION 4 - Maps. Scatterplots. Building a dashboard

## Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard

This dashboard consists of two interactive visualizations:

### 1. Map of Europe
- Displays sales using bubbles of varying sizes and profit margin (profitability) using color.
- Supports a geographic hierarchy: Country → State → City.
- Users can drill down interactively to choose the desired level of geographic detail.
### 2. Customer Scatter Plot
- Visualizes the relationship between customer sales and profit.
- Each point represents a customer, showing how their sales correlate with profitability.

## Interactivity & Features

### 2. Highlighting Action
    
Added a highlighting action:
